I am excited to tell that I am selected to GSoC 2017. I am selected to HolmesProcessing form HoneyNet community. Through out this project, I will be working on creating Template for HolmesProcessing. HolmesProcessing is a large scale malware analysis platform. There are many people who wants to use Holmes but were not able to use. I am selected to put all my understanding of Holmes into documentation.
